# NodeSchool Wellington


Come learn JavaScript at our weekly NodeSchool Wellington!

(ﾉ´ヮ´)ﾉ*:･ﾟ✧

This weekly Node.js night is for anyone who wants to learn or teach the art of JavaScript magic! It will be primarily self-directed, with available guidance from higher level mentors. You should have basic computer skills, a computer that runs Linux or Mac OS, and feel comfortable finding information on the internet. People from communities that have historically been excluded from tech are very much encouraged to join!

If you're new to Node.js, we recommend starting with the workshops at http://nodeschool.io to learn base JavaScript magic spells. If you have a Node.js project to work on, cast your spells and see what mad science emerges! If you want a project, find someone who wants help. The night is intended to be a low-stress environment to work together, get feedback on our projects, help each other get through difficult spots, and share tricks we learn. If at any point you feel lost, there will be higher level mentors available to talk to.

There are no fees for these sessions, but any koha for the event organizers is greatly appreciated ＼(＾▽＾)／
